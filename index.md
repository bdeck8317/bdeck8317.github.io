# Welcome!
My name is Benjamin Deck. I am currently a PhD student at Drexel University study Cognitive Neuroscience. Much of my work uses data science tools to understand human cognition in both health and disease. Like it says above, I am an aspiring data scientist with a soft spot for the scientific method and academia. Please check out some of my projects below. If you're interested in working together or in seeing some of my previous academic work see [my google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=twD1r-EAAAAJ&hl=en) or [my researchgate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin_Deck)
