# Welcome


My name is Benjamin Deck. I am currently a PhD student at Drexel University studying Cognitive Neuroscience. My work uses data science tools to 
understand human cognition in health and neuropsychiatric disorders. I am an aspiring data scientist with a soft spot for the scientific method and academia. 
Please check out some of my projects (follow link below). If youâ€™re interested in working together or in seeing some of my previous academic work see 
my google scholar page or my researchgate profile.
