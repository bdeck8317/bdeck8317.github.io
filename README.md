# Welcome


My name is Benjamin Deck. I am currently a PhD student at Drexel University studying Cognitive Neuroscience. Much of my work uses data science tools to 
understand human cognition in both health and disease. Like it says above, I am an aspiring data scientist with a soft spot for the scientific method and academia. 
Please check out some of my projects (follow link below). If youâ€™re interested in working together or in seeing some of my previous academic work see 
my google scholar page or my researchgate profile. 

Some of my main interests are in solving healthcare related data problems and understanding human behavior in various pathologies. At the moment,
much of my work surrounds predicting behavior given interactions within the human brain. I am looking to branch out from this and work with groups who are passionate about 
solving healthcare problems.
